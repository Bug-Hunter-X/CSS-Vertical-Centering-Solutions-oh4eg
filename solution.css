Several methods can correctly center the div both horizontally and vertically:

**Method 1: Flexbox**

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

**Method 2: Grid Layout**

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

**Method 3: Absolute Positioning**

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
div.parent{
  position: relative;
  height: 300px;
}
```
In this case, you would have to put the `div` with the above code in another div with the class of `parent`

Choose the method that best suits your project's structure and styling. Flexbox and Grid are generally preferred for their flexibility and maintainability.
